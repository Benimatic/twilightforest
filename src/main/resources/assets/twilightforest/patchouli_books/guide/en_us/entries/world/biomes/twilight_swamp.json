Clearing this place requires one of the Twilight Lich's magical Scepters in order to repel the Mosquitoes. There are mounds in this biome, perhaps indicating a presence of landmarks?"

This rather temperate biome has high abundance of Lava, and jets that erupt smoke and flames, all spread across a rusty red landscape. Because of the heat, adventurers need good nutrition in order to pass into the biome. It is said that a terrific monster resides in the remains of a Large Hollow Hill."
