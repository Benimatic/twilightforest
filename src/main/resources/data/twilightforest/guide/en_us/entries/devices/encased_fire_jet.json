      "text": "By taking a Fire Jet, and a bit of technical genius, I can create a Fire Jet that is self-sustaining and can fire with the press of a button, or a bit of Redstone signal. Though, a minor flaw with this device seems to be that it needs to warm up before it fires, so I must time the signals right."
