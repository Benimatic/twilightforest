============

* Use appropriate formatting
* Name all variables correctly
* Prefer deferring to vanilla methods as much as possible instead of copying
    * When copying, copy EXACTLY as is and make small comments to note tweaks made
    * Comment the class somewhere with [VanillaCopy] to signal that that region needs to be looked at whenever updates happen
* Remove dead code. Git exists for a reason
* Commented code is dead code!
* For the love of god use @Override.
